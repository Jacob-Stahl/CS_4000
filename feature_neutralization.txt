As stated in my proposal, feature neutralization is a regualization techniiqe designed to reduce a model's dependence on individual features in Numerai's dataset.
Features in financial datasets have a tendency to change thier relationship with target variables over time. This means that predictive models run the risk of being over-reliant
on individual features that can loose thier predictive power in production, or even inverting their prediction powet with the target variables.
